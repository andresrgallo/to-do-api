# To-do Application

## Application Overview

This application was developed with the purpose of improving my skills on NodeJs. The API was build using a RESTFUL architecture and Tested with Jest and Supertest libraries.
Mongodb was the database of choice with Mongoose as the ODM library to manage the data. A one to many relationship between User model and To-do model was used in order to enable each user to have unique to-dos. The Front end of the Application was built using the React library and the repository can be cloned at:
